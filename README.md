# Solving the Travelling Salesman Problem - Dynamic Programming and Hill Climbing
This project was sourced from a university project completed during my enrollment. The original repository has been kept private as per the university code of conduct, so this repository has all references to the university removed.

### Execution Line

The program can be executed via the following line:

```batch
java A2 N P tsp22.txt tsp23.txt tsp24.txt tsp25.txt tsp26.txt
```
The N and P values are both intended to be integers, and represent the Max Number of Iterations (N) and the Amount of Checks that can occur with no improvements to the current solution (P).

You can include additional files, or remove other files by simply adding another filename to the end of the command. The program will only execute the files supplied in order that they're given.

### Executing via file

The program can be executed by running the "<b>run.bat</b>" file in the folder. This batch file will compile and execute the program (the input files can be changed by editing the batch file itself). It will pause and display the output whilst deleting the generated <i>.class</i> files to keep the folder clean and organised.

### Executing via the command line

To execute via command line, launch the command prompt and change directory into the folder with the .java files and associated text input files. Run the command in the first section and press enter. The file should execute as expected.
